## Microsoft Azure Active Directory Authenticator
The Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Azure AD) authenticator is based on OpenID Connect, and is configured as a federated authenticator in WSO2 Identity Server. 
You can use the Microsoft Azure AD authenticator to authenticate Office365 users to sign in to your organization’s applications using OpenID Connect. Office 365 refers to subscription plans that include access to Office applications together with other productivity services that are enabled over the Internet (cloud services).
